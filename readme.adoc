== Welcome
The Kea is a mountain parrot. 

* It is a very intelligent bird. 
* It is also very curious. 
* It is also very social. 
* It is also very **playful**. 
* It is also very **mischievous**. 

Learning a new skill using tools and other materials can be difficult at times. I learn best if I can play and solve small riddles and puzzles. This is why I created this project. It collects my ideas and journey how I learned to use https://build123d.readthedocs.io[`build123d`].

It is thought used in addition to the official documentation and the tutorials there.

It is aimed to build your personal library of examples and snippets to achieve that bigger goals that you have in mind.

But before you fly high, you need to learn it.
